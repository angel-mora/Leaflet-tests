# Current tasks to Do

## Problems

1. This risk map is not as useful as it could be due to the fact it does not display clusters collapsed at big (in-depth) zoom levels.

*Inspect the source code [here](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/example/marker-clustering-realworld-maxzoom.388.html) to get a better idea.*

2. It also has an improvement opportunity regarding the way the clusters are grouping markers. Currently it clasify cluster with no specific chriteria more than pre-defined by plug-ins.

## Solutions

1. Implement a functionality such as ```L.markerClusterGroup({ disableClusteringAtZoom: 17 });``` in the markerClusterGroup function. WARNINGS: Implementation of this have been hard as markerClusterGroup is called with another function in line 194 of ```js/leaflet/map.js```.
2. Modify map clustering layers to group by territorial chriteria. This is achievable through R3gionBound plug-in located both in ```dist``` and ```examples``` folders.

### About Marker Clustering:

The real issues with this is that **both [Marker Cluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) and [Marker Cluster Layer Support](https://github.com/ghybs/Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport) plug-ins co-existing in the map**. So a level of complexity is added by the fact we have a layer control (line 212) that is collecting all layers so they don't display directly to the map but through the control instead. Extensive documentation exists for all plug-ins and all functionalities required are already defined in plug-ins documentation.

- [Leaflet Layer Control](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#control-layers)

## Posible approaches

As advised by the team, a viable solution might come by creating an event such as:

```
clickedMarker="";
mymap.on('zoomend', function() {
    if (clickedMarker!=="" && mymap.getZoom()>=mymap.options.maxZoom) {
        clickedMarker.__parent.spiderfy();
        clickedMarker="";
    }
});
```

Or

```
mymap.on('zoom', callback())
mymap.on('zoom', function() {
    // Spiderfy every visible cluster && disableClusteringAtZoom()
})
```

Despite the current inhability to complete the project, there have been set many routes to try to find a good solution.
