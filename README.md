Interactive map that allows you to geographically visualize data and analyze risk. This project include a Layer Control with Choroplet maps, Heatmaps, marker clustering and many other features.

## Built With

- Leaflet.js
- Marker Cluster Layer Control
- Heatmaps
- Choroplet maps

## How to

- To access its features, just click on the upper right corner to start exploring this amazing library.

## Features

- Choroplet maps are a simple way to visualize how a measure varies in a geographic area or to show the level of variability of that measure within a region. By clicking on each region, you can see the number of incidents for each state.
- Heat maps show the magnitude of a phenomenon as a color in two dimensions.
- It is a responsive map, which means that it is accessible to phones. You can access the map from almost anywhere.
- You can choose between two different base layers, light (default) and satellite, which allows you to observe the panorama at street level.

## Limitations

- Call the heatmap in small zoom because when you zoom in you cannot change the layer or deactivate it.
- The choroplane map does not sum individual layers yet.
